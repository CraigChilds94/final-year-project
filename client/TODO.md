# Todo

- Communicate between clients using a server
- Act on action messages
- Allow automated invoking of clients and messages (actions)
- Attempt to use an existing testing framework (if not extend/build own to do so)
- Collect some data
 - Response times
 - Memory usage
 - How number of clients effects these factors
 - Restrict testing with knowledge of restricted/fixed hardware
 - What happens if clients send messages simultaneously and vice versa
